					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Utilize data types and variables in lab 5.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Trying to insert an image of the car WITHIN the minor-section block and not have it clip was confusing. Elia directed both me and my lab partner to CSS's flexbox tag to fix it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Skimming through the lab tasks made it seem like it wouldn't take too much time, but the flexbox problem made it require a lot more time. I learned a valuable tool though!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="flex-test">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>You're looking at it! I'm glad and sort of proud of learning how to use the flexbox feature below.</p>
