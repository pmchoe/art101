				<h2>Rock Paper Scissors Pseudocode</h2>
				<pre>
		Display a welcome message and game instructions.
		Initialize variables
			player_score = 0
			computer_score = 0
			rounds_played = 0
			choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
		Repeat the following until the player chooses to quit:
		Prompt the player to choose one of the following options:
			"Rock"
			"Paper"
			"Scissors"
			"quit" (to exit the game)
		Generate a random choice for the computer from the "choices" list.
		Display the player's choice and the computer's choice.
		Compare the choices to determine the round winner:
		If player's choice == computer's choice, it's a tie.
		If (player's choice == "rock" and computer's choice == "scissors") or (player's choice == "paper" and computer's choice == "rock") or (player's choice == "scissors" and computer's choice == "paper"), then the player wins the round. 
			Otherwise, the computer wins the round. 
		Update the scores accordingly: 
			If the player wins, increment player_score by 1.
			If the computer wins, increment computer_score by 1.
		Display the round result (tie, player wins, or computer wins).
		Increment rounds_played by 1.
		Ask the player if they want to play another round or quit.
		Display the final game result, including the player's score, computer's score, and the number of rounds played.
		Thank the player for playing and then exit the game.

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>There was essentially only one weekend to finish this lab. Even though it didn't need a lot of heavy lifting, it still required planning outside both of my partner's and my regular meet-up schedules. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this lab was a good exercise that took focus away from coding and more into real-world practices of scheduling with co-workers/partners on a project.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Pseudocode is near the top. The first one is a guide on how to brush your teeth and the second one is high-level pseudocode for making a working Rock-Paper-Scissors game.</p>
