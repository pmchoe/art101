			<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Learning how to utilize arrays and objects for neater coding.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Me and Andres worked on the lab together over Discord, but at one point something happened to the wifi and disconnected my lab partner. There was also confusion on how to put multiple classes on one <div> but a quick Google search solved it.</div></p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab went pretty smoothly if you ignore the wifi incident. It would've went a lot worse with more headaches if we didn't figure out how to use flexbox for the image.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>You're looking at my index.html's final version! Here's the program execution below.</p>
